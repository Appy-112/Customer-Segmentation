# Customer-Segmentation
# Customer Segmentation & Purchase Prediction

# Project Summary
This project focuses on identifying different customer groups based on purchasing behavior and predicting their likelihood to make future purchases. The aim is to support targeted marketing, improve retention, and boost revenue through data-driven decisions.

# Business Problem
Businesses often struggle to identify loyal customers, understand purchasing patterns, and prevent churn. This project segments customers into meaningful groups (like Loyal, At Risk, New) and uses classification techniques to predict future purchase behavior.

# Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI (for dashboards & interactive visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (for cleaning/prep)
- DAX (Power BI formulas)

# Key Features
- RFM + Tenure analysis for customer segmentation
- KMeans clustering
- Purchase prediction using classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Power BI dashboard with insights like:
  - Segment-wise revenue contribution
  - Recency & frequency distribution
  - Retention trends
  - Smart insights using DAX

# Key Insights
- Loyal customers contribute over 40% of total revenue
- At-risk customers havenâ€™t purchased in 90+ days
- New customers show potential but have lower frequency
- Retention rate drops sharply after 120 days
